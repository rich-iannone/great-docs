# User Guides

Beyond API reference documentation, you often need narrative documentation: tutorials, guides, and explanations. Great Docs makes this easy with automatic User Guide support.

## Creating a User Guide

To add a User Guide to your documentation:

1. Create a `user_guide/` directory in your project root
2. Add `.qmd` files for each page
3. Run `great-docs build`

That's it! Great Docs automatically:

- Copies files to `great-docs/user-guide/`
- Generates sidebar navigation
- Adds a "User Guide" link to the navbar
- Organizes pages into sections

## Directory Structure

```{.default filename="Project structure"}
your-project/
├── great-docs/              # Build directory (ephemeral, gitignored)
│   ├── user-guide/          # Copied from user_guide/
│   └── ...
├── user_guide/              # Your source files (committed to git)
│   ├── 00-introduction.qmd
│   ├── 01-installation.qmd
│   ├── 02-quickstart.qmd
│   ├── 03-configuration.qmd
│   └── images/              # Asset directories are copied too
│       └── screenshot.png
├── great-docs.yml
├── pyproject.toml
└── your_package/
```

The `user_guide/` directory is the default location. You can use a [custom directory](#custom-user-guide-directory) by setting `user_guide` in `great-docs.yml`.

## Page Ordering

Files are sorted alphabetically by filename. Use numeric prefixes to control order:

```{.default filename="user_guide/"}
user_guide/
├── 00-introduction.qmd    # First
├── 01-installation.qmd    # Second
├── 02-getting-started.qmd # Third
└── 03-advanced.qmd        # Fourth
```

The prefix is stripped from the title, so `01-installation.qmd` becomes "Installation" in the navigation.

## Organizing into Sections

Group related pages into sections using the `guide-section` frontmatter key:

```{.yaml filename="01-installation.qmd"}
---
title: "Installation"
guide-section: "Getting Started"
---
```

Pages with the same `guide-section` value are grouped together in the sidebar:

```{.default filename="Sidebar navigation"}
User Guide
├── Getting Started
│   ├── Introduction
│   └── Installation
├── Core Concepts
│   ├── Configuration
│   └── API Documentation
└── Advanced
    └── Customization
```

### Section Order

Sections appear in the order they're first encountered (based on file sort order). To control section order, ensure the first file in each section has the appropriate prefix:

```{.default filename="user_guide/"}
user_guide/
├── 00-introduction.qmd      # guide-section: "Getting Started"
├── 01-installation.qmd      # guide-section: "Getting Started"
├── 10-configuration.qmd     # guide-section: "Core Concepts"
├── 11-api-docs.qmd          # guide-section: "Core Concepts"
├── 20-customization.qmd     # guide-section: "Advanced"
```

## Writing Pages

User Guide pages are standard Quarto Markdown files, which means you have access to all of Quarto's powerful features for creating rich, interactive documentation. Here are some of the most useful features for writing guides.

### Basic Frontmatter

Every User Guide page needs frontmatter at the top to define its title and section. The `title` appears in the sidebar navigation and as the page heading, while `guide-section` determines which group the page belongs to:

```{.yaml filename="your-page.qmd"}
---
title: "Your Page Title"
guide-section: "Section Name"
---
```

### Code Blocks

Code blocks with syntax highlighting are essential for technical documentation. Specify the language after the opening backticks to enable highlighting:

````markdown
```python
from great_docs import GreatDocs

docs = GreatDocs()
docs.build()
```
````

Quarto supports syntax highlighting for dozens of languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, R, Bash, YAML, TOML, and many more.

For Python code that you want to actually execute and show the output, use `{python}` instead of just `python`. You can control execution behavior with hash-pipe options at the top of the code block. Some useful hash-pipe options include:

- `#| echo: false` – Hide the code, show only output
- `#| eval: false` – Show the code but don't run it
- `#| output: false` – Run the code but hide output
- `#| warning: false` – Suppress warning messages
- `#| fig-cap: "Caption"` – Add a caption to figure output

### Tabsets

Tabsets let you present alternative content (like code in multiple languages or instructions for different platforms) without cluttering the page. Readers can click to switch between tabs:

````markdown
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Python

```python
print("Hello")
```

## JavaScript

```javascript
console.log("Hello");
```

:::
````

This is particularly useful for showing installation commands for different operating systems or demonstrating concepts in multiple programming languages.

### Callouts

Callouts draw attention to important information. Use them sparingly to highlight notes, warnings, or tips that readers shouldn't miss:

```markdown
::: {.callout-note}
This is a note.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
This is a warning.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
This is a tip.
:::
```

Each callout type has distinct styling. Notes are informational, warnings alert readers to potential issues, and tips offer helpful suggestions.

### Images

Visual content like screenshots, diagrams, and architecture charts can greatly improve documentation. Store images in a subdirectory to keep your User Guide organized:

```{.default filename="user_guide/"}
user_guide/
├── 01-getting-started.qmd
└── images/
    └── screenshot.png
```

Reference them in your content using standard Markdown image syntax. The alt text in brackets improves accessibility:

```markdown
![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)
```

### Cross-References

Link freely between pages to help readers navigate related content. For other User Guide pages, use relative paths:

```markdown
See the [Installation](installation.qmd) guide for details.
```

To link to API reference pages, use a relative path that goes up one directory level first:

```markdown
See the [GreatDocs](../reference/GreatDocs.qmd) class for the full API.
```

These links are validated during the build, so you'll catch broken references early.

## Asset Directories

Subdirectories that don't contain `.qmd` files are treated as asset directories and copied as-is:

```{.default filename="user_guide/"}
user_guide/
├── 01-guide.qmd
├── images/          # Copied to great-docs/user-guide/images/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── diagram.svg
└── data/            # Copied to great-docs/user-guide/data/
    └── example.json
```

## User Guide Styling

Great Docs applies different styling to User Guide pages compared to API reference pages, optimizing for the narrative documentation experience. The sidebar filter that helps navigate large APIs is hidden since user guides are typically smaller and have a clear hierarchical structure. Breadcrumb navigation is also removed to provide a cleaner reading experience. The sidebar itself uses section-based navigation that mirrors your `guide-section` organization, making it easy for readers to see where they are in the documentation.

## Example: This User Guide

The Great Docs User Guide you're reading uses this exact structure:

```
user_guide/
├── 00-introduction.qmd      # Getting Started
├── 01-installation.qmd      # Getting Started
├── 02-quickstart.qmd        # Getting Started
├── 03-configuration.qmd     # Core Concepts
├── 04-api-documentation.qmd # Core Concepts
├── 05-cli-documentation.qmd # Core Concepts
├── 06-user-guides.qmd       # Core Concepts
└── 07-deployment.qmd        # Deployment
```

## Custom User Guide Directory

By default, Great Docs looks for a `user_guide/` directory in your project root. If you need your User Guide source files in a different location (e.g., inside a `docs/` folder or a monorepo subdirectory), you can specify a custom path in `great-docs.yml`:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
user_guide: docs/guides
```

The path is relative to the project root. Any directory structure works, including nested paths:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
user_guide: content/user-docs
```

### Precedence Rules

If both a `user_guide` config option **and** a conventional `user_guide/` directory exist, the config option takes precedence and the `user_guide/` directory is ignored. Great Docs will print a warning to let you know:

```
⚠️  Both 'user_guide' config option ('docs/guides') and 'user_guide/' directory exist; using configured path
```

### Warnings

Great Docs warns you if the resolved directory:

- **Doesn't exist** — the path specified in `user_guide` couldn't be found
- **Is empty** — the directory exists but contains no files at all
- **Has no `.qmd` files** — the directory exists but doesn't contain any Quarto Markdown files

In all three cases, the User Guide is skipped and processing continues normally.

## Tips

### Keep Source Separate from Output

Whether you use the default `user_guide/` directory or a custom path, Great Docs copies files to `great-docs/user-guide/` during each build, keeping your source separate from generated output.

### Use Descriptive Titles

The `title` in frontmatter appears in navigation. Make it clear and concise:

```yaml
---
title: "Configuration Options"  # Good
guide-section: "Reference"
---
```

### Organize Logically

Group related content into sections that make sense for your users. A common pattern starts with "Getting Started" content that covers installation and quick start guides. This is everything new users need to get up and running. "Core Concepts" sections explain the main features and typical usage patterns. "Advanced" sections dive into complex topics and customization options for power users. Finally, a "Reference" section can house configuration options and troubleshooting guides. Adapt this structure to fit your project's needs.
