            def merge_dicts(a: dict, b: dict) -> dict:
                """
                Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.

                Creates a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from
                both ``a`` and ``b``. When keys overlap, values from ``b``
                take precedence.

                Parameters
                ----------
                a
                    The base dictionary.
                b
                    The dictionary whose values take priority on conflict.

                Returns
                -------
                dict
                    A new dictionary containing the merged key-value pairs.

                Notes
                -----
                The merge algorithm works in two phases. First, a shallow copy
                of ``a`` is created using ``dict.copy()``. Then, all entries
                from ``b`` are inserted into the copy using ``dict.update()``.

                This means that the original dictionaries ``a`` and ``b`` are
                never modified. However, because only a shallow copy is made,
                mutable values (such as lists or nested dicts) are shared
                between the original and the merged result.

                If you need a deep merge where nested structures are also
                merged recursively, consider using ``copy.deepcopy()`` on the
                result or implementing a custom recursive merge function.

                The time complexity is ``O(len(a) + len(b))`` since both
                the copy and update operations are linear.

                Examples
                --------
                >>> merge_dicts({"x": 1}, {"y": 2})
                {'x': 1, 'y': 2}

                >>> merge_dicts({"x": 1}, {"x": 99})
                {'x': 99}
                """
                result = a.copy()
                result.update(b)
                return result


            def flatten_list(nested: list) -> list:
                """
                Flatten an arbitrarily nested list into a single flat list.

                Recursively traverses the input list and collects all
                non-list elements into a single flat list.

                Parameters
                ----------
                nested
                    A potentially nested list of values.

                Returns
                -------
                list
                    A flat list containing all leaf elements.

                Notes
                -----
                The function uses recursion to handle arbitrarily deep nesting.
                For each element in the input, it checks whether the element
                is itself a ``list``. If so, it recurses into that sublist.
                Otherwise, the element is appended to the result.

                Because Python has a default recursion limit of 1000, this
                function will raise a ``RecursionError`` for lists nested
                deeper than approximately 500 levels (accounting for the
                two-frame overhead per recursive call).

                The implementation allocates a new list and extends it with
                each recursive result. The overall time complexity is
                ``O(n)`` where ``n`` is the total number of leaf elements,
                but the constant factor depends on the nesting depth due
                to intermediate list allocations.

                Examples
                --------
                >>> flatten_list([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6])
                [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

                >>> flatten_list([[["deep"]]])
                ['deep']

                result = []

                        result.extend(flatten_list(item))
