# Configuration

Great Docs is designed to work with zero configuration, but you can customize its behavior through your `pyproject.toml` file. This page covers all available options, from API discovery settings to author information and GitHub integration.

## Configuration Location

All Great Docs settings go in your `pyproject.toml` under the `[tool.great-docs]` section. This keeps your documentation configuration alongside other tool settings in a single, version-controlled file:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
# Your settings here
```

## API Discovery Settings

### Including Specific Items

By default, Great Docs auto-excludes common internal names like `main`, `cli`, `version`, etc. To force-include any of these:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
include = ["main", "cli"]
```

### Excluding Items

To exclude specific items from documentation:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
exclude = ["InternalClass", "helper_function"]
```

### Auto-Excluded Names

Great Docs automatically excludes these common internal names:

| Category | Names |
|----------|-------|
| CLI/Entry points | `main`, `cli` |
| Version/Metadata | `version`, `VERSION`, `VERSION_INFO` |
| Module re-exports | `core`, `utils`, `helpers`, `constants`, `config`, `settings` |
| Standard library | `PackageNotFoundError`, `typing`, `annotations`, `TYPE_CHECKING` |
| Logging | `logger`, `log`, `logging` |

## GitHub Integration

### GitHub Link Style

Choose how the GitHub link appears in the navbar:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
github_style = "widget"  # Shows stars count (default)
# or
github_style = "icon"    # Simple GitHub icon
```

### Source Links

Great Docs automatically creates "source" links to GitHub. Configure the branch:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
source_link_branch = "main"  # Default: auto-detected from git
```

To disable source links entirely:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
source_links_enabled = false
```

## Sidebar Filter

The API reference sidebar includes a search filter for large APIs. Configure it:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
sidebar_filter_enabled = true   # Enable/disable (default: true)
sidebar_filter_min_items = 20   # Minimum items before showing filter
```

## Dark Mode Toggle

Great Docs includes a light/dark mode toggle in the navbar that respects system preferences and remembers user choice. It's enabled by default:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
dark_mode_toggle = true   # Enable/disable (default: true)
```

To disable the dark mode toggle:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
dark_mode_toggle = false
```

When enabled, the toggle appears in the navbar and:

- Detects the user's system color scheme preference on first visit
- Persists the user's choice in local storage
- Provides instant switching without page reload

## Large Class Method Threshold

Classes with many methods get their methods documented on separate pages for better navigation. By default, classes with more than 5 methods trigger this behavior. Adjust the threshold:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
large_class_method_threshold = 10  # Default: 5
```

Set to a higher value to keep more methods inline, or lower to separate methods sooner.

## CLI Documentation

Enable automatic CLI documentation for Click-based CLIs:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs.cli]
enabled = true
```

With optional explicit configuration:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs.cli]
enabled = true
module = "my_package.cli"  # Module containing Click commands
name = "cli"                # Name of the Click command object
```

See [CLI Documentation](04-cli-documentation.qmd) for details.

## Author Information

Customize author display in the landing page sidebar:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[[tool.great-docs.authors]]
name = "Your Name"
email = "you@example.com"
role = "Lead Developer"
affiliation = "Organization"
github = "yourusername"
homepage = "https://yoursite.com"
orcid = "0000-0002-1234-5678"
```

Multiple authors are supported:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[[tool.great-docs.authors]]
name = "First Author"
role = "Lead Developer"
github = "firstauthor"

[[tool.great-docs.authors]]
name = "Second Author"
role = "Contributor"
github = "secondauthor"
```

### Supported Author Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | **Required.** Author's full name |
| `email` | Email address (clickable icon) |
| `role` | Role in the project (e.g., "Lead Developer") |
| `affiliation` | Organization or institution |
| `github` | GitHub username (clickable icon) |
| `homepage` | Personal website URL (clickable icon) |
| `orcid` | ORCID identifier (clickable icon) |

## Complete Example

While most projects only need a few settings, here's a comprehensive configuration that demonstrates all available options working together. This example shows a well-configured project with custom API discovery rules, GitHub integration, sidebar filtering, CLI documentation, and detailed author information.

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.great-docs]
# API discovery
include = ["cli"]
exclude = ["_InternalClass"]

# GitHub integration
github_style = "widget"
source_link_branch = "main"

# Sidebar
sidebar_filter_enabled = true
sidebar_filter_min_items = 15

# Dark mode
dark_mode_toggle = true

# Large class handling
large_class_method_threshold = 8

# CLI documentation
[tool.great-docs.cli]
enabled = true

# Authors
[[tool.great-docs.authors]]
name = "Jane Developer"
email = "jane@example.com"
role = "Lead Developer"
github = "janedev"
orcid = "0000-0001-2345-6789"

[[tool.great-docs.authors]]
name = "John Contributor"
role = "Contributor"
github = "johncontrib"
```

You don't need all of these settings. Start with just the options you need and add more as your project grows. The defaults work well for most packages, so you may find that a minimal configuration (or none at all) is sufficient.

## Quarto Configuration

Great Docs generates and maintains a `_quarto.yml` file in your docs directory. This file controls how Quarto renders your site, including navigation, theming, and the quartodoc API reference configuration.

**Should you edit it?** Generally, no. Great Docs updates this file automatically during `great-docs build` to keep API sections in sync with your package exports. Manual edits to the `quartodoc.sections` area will be overwritten. However, you can safely customize other parts like the site title, theme, or additional navbar items.

**Should you commit it?** Yes: commit `_quarto.yml` along with your other docs files. This ensures your documentation builds consistently across environments, including GitHub Actions CI.

**GitHub CI considerations:** When using `great-docs setup-github-pages`, the workflow runs `great-docs build` which regenerates any auto-managed sections. This means CI builds will always use the latest API structure from your code, keeping documentation in sync even if local `_quarto.yml` changes weren't committed.

Here's what a typical configuration looks like:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website
  post-render: scripts/post-render.py

website:
  title: "Your Package"
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: Home
        href: index.qmd
      - text: Reference
        href: reference/index.qmd
    right:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/you/your-package

format:
  html:
    theme: flatly
    css:
      - great-docs.css

quartodoc:
  package: your_package
  dir: reference
  title: Reference
  style: pkgdown
  sections:
    # Auto-generated sections
```

The `quartodoc.sections` block is regenerated each build, but the rest of the file is preserved. If you need to customize theming or add extra pages to the navbar, those changes will persist across builds.
