# Configuration

Great Docs is designed to work with zero configuration, but you can customize its behavior through a `great-docs.yml` file. This page covers all available options, from API discovery settings to author information and GitHub integration.

## Configuration Location

All Great Docs settings go in a `great-docs.yml` file in your project root directory. This dedicated configuration file keeps your documentation settings separate and easy to manage:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
# Your settings here
```

To generate a starter configuration file with all options documented:

```bash
great-docs config
```

## API Discovery Settings

### Including Specific Items

By default, Great Docs auto-excludes common internal names like `main`, `cli`, `version`, etc. To force-include any of these:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
include:
  - main
  - cli
```

### Excluding Items

To exclude specific items from documentation:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
exclude:
  - InternalClass
  - helper_function
```

### Auto-Excluded Names

Great Docs automatically excludes these common internal names:

| Category | Names |
|----------|-------|
| CLI/Entry points | `main`, `cli` |
| Version/Metadata | `version`, `VERSION`, `VERSION_INFO` |
| Module re-exports | `core`, `utils`, `helpers`, `constants`, `config`, `settings` |
| Standard library | `PackageNotFoundError`, `typing`, `annotations`, `TYPE_CHECKING` |
| Logging | `logger`, `log`, `logging` |

## GitHub Integration

### GitHub Link Style

Choose how the GitHub link appears in the navbar:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
# Shows stars count (default)
github_style: widget

# Or use a simple GitHub icon
github_style: icon
```

### Source Links

Great Docs automatically creates "source" links to GitHub. Configure the branch:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
source:
  branch: main  # Default: auto-detected from git
```

To disable source links entirely:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
source:
  enabled: false
```

Full source link configuration:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
source:
  enabled: true        # Enable/disable source links (default: true)
  branch: main         # Git branch/tag to link to (default: auto-detect)
  path: src/package    # Custom source path for monorepos (default: auto-detect)
  placement: usage     # Where to place the link: "usage" (default) or "title"
```

## Sidebar Filter

The API reference sidebar includes a search filter for large APIs. Configure it:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
sidebar_filter:
  enabled: true   # Enable/disable filter (default: true)
  min_items: 20   # Minimum items before showing filter (default: 20)
```

## Dark Mode Toggle

Great Docs includes a light/dark mode toggle in the navbar that respects system preferences and remembers user choice. It's enabled by default:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
dark_mode_toggle: true   # Enable/disable (default: true)
```

To disable the dark mode toggle:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
dark_mode_toggle: false
```

When enabled, the toggle appears in the navbar and:

- Detects the user's system color scheme preference on first visit
- Persists the user's choice in local storage
- Provides instant switching without page reload

## Large Class Method Threshold

Classes with many methods get their methods documented on separate pages for better navigation. By default, classes with more than 5 methods trigger this behavior. Adjust the threshold:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
large_class_method_threshold: 10  # Default: 5
```

Set to a higher value to keep more methods inline, or lower to separate methods sooner.

## CLI Documentation

Enable automatic CLI documentation for Click-based CLIs:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
cli:
  enabled: true
```

With optional explicit configuration:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
cli:
  enabled: true
  module: my_package.cli   # Module containing Click commands
  name: cli                # Name of the Click command object
```

See [CLI Documentation](05-cli-documentation.qmd) for details.

## Author Information

Customize author display in the landing page sidebar:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
authors:
  - name: Your Name
    email: you@example.com
    role: Lead Developer
    affiliation: Organization
    github: yourusername
    homepage: https://yoursite.com
    orcid: 0000-0002-1234-5678
```

Multiple authors are supported:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
authors:
  - name: First Author
    role: Lead Developer
    github: firstauthor

  - name: Second Author
    role: Contributor
    github: secondauthor
```

### Supported Author Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | **Required.** Author's full name |
| `email` | Email address (clickable icon) |
| `role` | Role in the project (e.g., "Lead Developer") |
| `affiliation` | Organization or institution |
| `github` | GitHub username (clickable icon) |
| `homepage` | Personal website URL (clickable icon) |
| `orcid` | ORCID identifier (clickable icon) |

## API Reference Structure

Control how your API documentation is organized with the `reference` config:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
reference:
  - title: Core Classes
    desc: Main classes for working with the package
    contents:
      - name: MyClass
        members: separate    # Methods get their own pages
      - SimpleClass          # Methods documented inline

  - title: Utility Functions
    desc: Helper functions for common tasks
    contents:
      - helper_func
      - another_func
```

If no `reference` config is provided, Great Docs auto-generates sections from discovered exports.

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive configuration demonstrating all available options:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
# API Discovery
include:
  - cli
exclude:
  - _InternalClass

# GitHub Integration
github_style: widget

# Source Links
source:
  enabled: true
  branch: main
  placement: usage

# Sidebar
sidebar_filter:
  enabled: true
  min_items: 15

# Dark Mode
dark_mode_toggle: true

# Large Class Handling
large_class_method_threshold: 8

# CLI Documentation
cli:
  enabled: true

# API Reference Structure
reference:
  - title: Core Classes
    desc: Main classes for the library
    contents:
      - name: MainClass
        members: separate
      - HelperClass

  - title: Utility Functions
    desc: Helper functions
    contents:
      - utility_func
      - helper_func

# Authors
authors:
  - name: Jane Developer
    email: jane@example.com
    role: Lead Developer
    github: janedev
    orcid: 0000-0001-2345-6789

  - name: John Contributor
    role: Contributor
    github: johncontrib
```

You don't need all of these settings. Start with just the options you need and add more as your project grows. The defaults work well for most packages, so you may find that a minimal configuration (or none at all) is sufficient.

## Generating a Configuration File

To create a starter `great-docs.yml` with all options documented:

```bash
great-docs config
```

This creates a file with all available options as comments, making it easy to enable the features you need.

## Quarto Configuration

Great Docs generates and maintains a `_quarto.yml` file in your docs directory. This file controls how Quarto renders your site, including navigation, theming, and the quartodoc API reference configuration.

**Should you edit it?** Generally, no. Great Docs updates this file automatically during `great-docs build` to keep API sections in sync with your package exports. Manual edits to the `quartodoc.sections` area will be overwritten. However, you can safely customize other parts like the site title, theme, or additional navbar items.

**Should you commit it?** Yes: commit `_quarto.yml` along with your other docs files. This ensures your documentation builds consistently across environments, including GitHub Actions CI.

**GitHub CI considerations:** When using `great-docs setup-github-pages`, the workflow runs `great-docs build` which regenerates any auto-managed sections. This means CI builds will always use the latest API structure from your code, keeping documentation in sync even if local `_quarto.yml` changes weren't committed.
