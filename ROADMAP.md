# Great Docs — Roadmap

## Planned — Near Term

High-value features that build on existing infrastructure.

### Author Attribution & Avatars

Display author information with circular GitHub-style avatars on authored pages.

- Author name and image from page YAML frontmatter (`author: {name, image, url}`)
- Multiple author avatars displayed in a row
- Circular avatar images (falls back to initials when no image)
- Hover tooltip shows full author name
- Author lookup from `great-docs.yml` `authors:` list for full metadata
- Only shown on authored pages (user guide, blog, recipes) with explicit `author:` frontmatter
- Auto-generated pages (reference, changelog) show timestamps only, no author
- Optional `team_author:` config for a catch-all team attribution (e.g., "Great Tables Team")
- `site.show_author: true/false` to enable/disable author display

### Reading Time Estimate

Auto-calculate and display estimated reading time.

- Word count-based calculation shown near page title
- Configurable words-per-minute rate
- Override via frontmatter (`readtime: 15`)
- Show/hide globally or per-page
- Useful for user guide articles, tutorials, and blog posts

### Breadcrumb Navigation

Display navigation path above page content.

- Breadcrumb trail showing hierarchy (Home > User Guide > Configuration)
- Clickable links to parent sections
- Helps orientation in deep documentation structures
- Hide per-page via frontmatter if desired
- Responsive design for mobile

### Enhanced CLI Reference

API-reference-style rendering for CLI applications.

- **Click** (primary): Parse command/group decorators to extract structure
- **Typer**: Leverage Click internals via Typer's underlying Click commands
- **argparse**: Parse `ArgumentParser` definitions and subparsers
- **Fire**: Introspect Python functions/classes exposed as CLI
- **Extensible**: Plugin interface for additional CLI frameworks
- Generate `.qmd` pages with prose sections for each command and subcommand
- Render arguments, options, and flags in styled parameter tables (like API reference)
- Include type annotations, defaults, and help text
- Auto-generate usage examples from framework-specific example metadata
- Cross-reference between subcommands and parent groups
- Search integration: CLI commands indexed alongside API symbols
- Support for command aliases and deprecated commands
- Environment variable documentation
- Alternative to raw `--help` output: richer formatting, navigation, and discoverability

- Hierarchical project trees (parent/child relationships)
- Independent build cycles with unified deployment
- Common assets and theming across subprojects

### Offline Documentation

Self-contained sites that work without an internet connection.

- Author profiles with avatars and bios
- Categories and tags per post
- RSS feed generation
- Reading time and publication date display
- Pinned/featured posts

- Blog-only mode (documentation optional)

### Instant Loading

SPA-like navigation without full page reloads.

- Anchor tracking (URL updates as you scroll)
- Significantly faster perceived navigation

### Code Annotations

Rich inline annotations inside code blocks.

- Numbered markers in code comments pointing to explanations
- Click/hover to reveal annotation content
- Supports any language with comment syntax
- Nestable annotations
- Works inside admonitions and content tabs
- Strip comment markers option for cleaner display

### Comment System Integration

## Planned — Long Term

Larger efforts for future milestones.

### Plugin / Extension System

Allow third-party extensions to hook into the build pipeline.

- `great-docs.yml` plugin registration
- Hook points: `pre-init`, `post-discovery`, `pre-render`, `post-render`
- Package discovery via entry points (`great_docs.plugins`)
- Example plugins: custom renderers, extra page generators, analytics adapters

### Clean URLs

Strip `.html` extensions from page URLs (e.g., `/user-guide/configuration` instead of `/user-guide/configuration.html`).

- Ideally handled natively by Quarto (no upstream support yet; tracking for if/when it lands)
- Fallback: post-render script that restructures `page.html` → `page/index.html` and rewrites all internal links
- Rewrite sidebar, navbar, cross-references, search index, `objects.json`, and sitemap paths
- Works out-of-the-box on GitHub Pages (serves `dir/index.html` at `/dir/`); trivial on Netlify/Vercel/CloudFlare
- `clean_urls: true` config option in `great-docs.yml`

### Interactive Examples

Live, runnable code blocks in the browser.

- Pyodide or JupyterLite backend
- `{interactive}` code cell annotation in `.qmd`
- Sandboxed execution with output display
- Fallback to static output when JS is disabled

### Accessibility Audit & Improvements

Systematic WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

- ARIA landmarks and labels on all navigation
- Keyboard navigation for sidebar, search, dark mode toggle
- Color contrast verification across all themes
- Screen reader testing and fixes
- Skip-to-content links

### Theme Customization Gallery

Pre-built color schemes and typography presets.

- `site.theme` config with named presets (e.g., `flatly`, `cosmo`, `solar`)
- CSS variable overrides for custom branding
- Gallery page in Great Docs documentation showing all presets
- User-contributed themes via plugin system

### Template Library

Starter templates for different project types.

- Minimal (API-only)
- Full-featured (API + CLI + User Guide + Notebooks)
- Scientific package
- Data analysis toolkit
- `great-docs init --template <name>` CLI option

### Multi-Language Documentation Sites

Full site translation with a language selector widget.

- Parallel content directories per language (`docs/en/`, `docs/es/`, etc.)
- Language selector dropdown in navbar
- `hreflang` tags for SEO
- Fallback to default language for untranslated pages
- Shared assets and cross-language linking

### AI-Assisted Translation
