# Changelog

Great Docs can automatically generate a Changelog page from your GitHub Releases. Each published release becomes a section on the page, with its title, date, body content, and a link back to the release on GitHub.

## How It Works

When changelog generation is enabled (the default), `great-docs build` will:

1. **Detect your GitHub repository** – reads the `Repository` URL from `[project.urls]` in `pyproject.toml`
2. **Fetch releases** – calls the GitHub Releases API to retrieve published releases
3. **Generate the page** – writes a `changelog.qmd` file in the build directory with one section per release
4. **Add a navbar link** – adds a "Changelog" item to the site's top navigation bar

The result is a fully rendered Changelog page that stays in sync with your GitHub Releases — no manual maintenance needed.

## Prerequisites

Your `pyproject.toml` must include a `Repository` URL pointing to GitHub:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[project.urls]
Repository = "https://github.com/your-org/your-package"
```

If no GitHub URL is found, the changelog step is silently skipped.

## Configuration

The changelog works out of the box with sensible defaults. To customize behavior, add a `changelog` section to `great-docs.yml`:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
changelog:
  enabled: true        # Enable/disable changelog (default: true)
  max_releases: 50     # Maximum releases to include (default: 50)
```

### Disabling the Changelog

If you don't want a changelog page at all:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
changelog:
  enabled: false
```

### Limiting Releases

For projects with many releases, you can cap how many appear:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
changelog:
  max_releases: 20
```

Releases are shown in reverse chronological order (newest first), so older releases are the ones omitted.

## Authentication

The GitHub API allows unauthenticated requests but with a low rate limit (60 requests/hour). For most projects this is fine, but if you hit rate limits — particularly in CI — set a GitHub token:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

Great Docs checks for `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` environment variables and uses whichever is set. A token raises the rate limit to 5,000 requests/hour.

## GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions workflows, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is already available automatically. No extra setup is needed.

## Standalone CLI Command

You can generate the changelog independently of a full build:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
great-docs changelog
```

This is useful for testing or regenerating just the changelog. You can also override the max releases:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
great-docs changelog --max-releases 10
```

## What Gets Included

- **Published releases** — shown with their title, date, and body
- **Pre-releases** — included but marked with a "(Pre-release)" badge
- **Draft releases** — excluded (they aren't public yet)

The release body is rendered as Markdown, so any formatting, lists, headings, or code blocks in your GitHub Release notes carry through to the documentation site.

## Generated Output

The generated `changelog.qmd` page includes:

- A title ("Changelog") and table of contents
- An introductory line linking to the full GitHub Releases page
- One `##` section per release, containing:
  - The release name as the heading
  - A metadata line with the publication date and a "View on GitHub" link
  - The full release body as Markdown

Here's an example of what a section looks like:

```markdown
## Version 2.0.0

*2026-01-15* · [View on GitHub](https://github.com/org/pkg/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

### What's New

- Added feature X
- Improved performance of Y

### Breaking Changes

- Removed deprecated `old_function()`
```

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No GitHub URL in `pyproject.toml` | Changelog step is skipped silently |
| Repository exists but has no releases | No `changelog.qmd` is created; build continues normally |
| GitHub API rate limit reached | Warning printed; partial results used if any were already fetched |
| GitHub API returns 404 | Warning printed; changelog skipped |
| Network error | Warning printed; changelog skipped |

In all cases, the build completes successfully — the changelog is never a hard failure.

## Next Steps

- **[Configuration](configuration.qmd)** – See all available `great-docs.yml` options
- **[Deployment](deployment.qmd)** – Deploy your docs (including the changelog) to GitHub Pages
