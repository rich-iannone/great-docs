# Configuration

Great Docs is designed to work with zero configuration, but you can customize its behavior through a `great-docs.yml` file. This page covers all available options, from API discovery settings to author information and GitHub integration.

## Configuration Location

All Great Docs settings go in a `great-docs.yml` file in your project root directory. This dedicated configuration file keeps your documentation settings separate and easy to manage:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
# Your settings here
```

To generate a starter configuration file with all options documented:

```bash
great-docs config
```

## Display Name

By default, Great Docs uses your package name exactly as-is for the site title and navbar. For packages with technical names like `my_package` or `my-package`, you might want a more polished presentation name.

### Setting a Display Name

Use the `display_name` field to specify how your package name appears in the site:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
display_name: My Package
```

This will display `My Package` in the navbar instead of the actual package name.

### When to Use It

Common use cases for `display_name`:

- **Branding**: Convert technical names to marketing names
  - `weathervault` -> `WeatherVault`
  - `great_docs` -> `Great Docs`

- **Readability**: Add spaces and capitalization
  - `my_awesome_lib` -> `My Awesome Lib`
  - `data-processor` -> `Data Processor`

- **Product names**: Use your product's official name
  - `ml_toolkit` -> `ML Toolkit Pro`

### Default Behavior

If you don't specify `display_name`:

- the site title will be your actual package name
- no automatic title-casing or transformation is applied
- `great_docs` stays as `great_docs`, not `Great Docs`
- `my-package` stays as `my-package`, not `My Package`

This ensures predictable behavior and respects your package's actual naming.

## API Discovery Settings

### Excluding Items

To exclude specific items from documentation during `init` and `scan`:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
exclude:
  - InternalClass
  - helper_function
```

Note: The `exclude` setting affects what appears when running `great-docs init` (which auto-generates your `reference` config) and `great-docs scan` (which shows discovered exports). Once you have a `reference` config, you control exactly what's documented by listing items there.

### Auto-Excluded Names

Great Docs automatically excludes these common internal names during discovery:

| Category | Names |
|----------|-------|
| CLI/Entry points | `main`, `cli` |
| Version/Metadata | `version`, `VERSION`, `VERSION_INFO` |
| Module re-exports | `core`, `utils`, `helpers`, `constants`, `config`, `settings` |
| Standard library | `PackageNotFoundError`, `typing`, `annotations`, `TYPE_CHECKING` |
| Logging | `logger`, `log`, `logging` |

## Docstring Parser

Different projects use different docstring conventions, so Great Docs automatically detects your docstring style during initialization.

### Supported Styles

| Style | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `numpy` | NumPy-style with section underlines | `Parameters\n----------` |
| `google` | Google-style with indented sections | `Args:\n    x: The value` |
| `sphinx` | Sphinx-style with field markers | `:param x: The value` |

### Automatic Detection

When you run `great-docs init`, Great Docs analyzes your package's docstrings to detect the style:

- **NumPy style** is identifiable by section headers with `---` underlines (e.g., `Parameters\n----------`)
- **Google style** is identifiable by section headers with colons (e.g., `Args:`, `Returns:`)
- **Sphinx style** is identifiable by field markers (e.g., `:param:`, `:returns:`, `:rtype:`)

The detected style is saved to `great-docs.yml` and forwarded to quartodoc during builds.

### Manual Configuration

If auto-detection doesn't work for your project, or you want to override it:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
parser: google  # Options: numpy (default), google, sphinx
```

### When to Change the Parser

You might need to manually set the parser if:

- your package has few or no docstrings (detection defaults to `numpy`)
- you use a mix of styles and want to standardize on one
- auto-detection chose the wrong style

### Example Docstrings

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### NumPy Style

```python
def my_function(x, y):
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
      The first number.
    y
      The second number.

    Returns
    -------
    int
      The sum of x and y.
    """
    return x + y
```

#### Google Style

```python
def my_function(x, y):
    """Add two numbers together.

    Args:
      x: The first number.
      y: The second number.

    Returns:
      The sum of x and y.
    """
    return x + y
```

#### Sphinx Style

```python
def my_function(x, y):
    """Add two numbers together.

    :param x: The first number.
    :type x: int
    :param y: The second number.
    :type y: int
    :returns: The sum of x and y.
    :rtype: int
    """
    return x + y
```

:::

## Dynamic Introspection

Great Docs uses [quartodoc](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/) to generate API reference pages. By default, quartodoc uses **dynamic introspection** (importing your package at runtime), which produces the most accurate documentation for complex packages with re-exports and aliases.

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
dynamic: true   # Default: true
```

Some packages have internal attributes that cause errors during dynamic introspection. If this happens, Great Docs will **automatically retry the build with static analysis** (`dynamic: false`). You'll see a message like:

```
⚠️  quartodoc build failed with dynamic introspection.
   Retrying with static analysis (dynamic: false)...
```

To skip the retry and always use static analysis, set it explicitly:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
dynamic: false
```

### When to Set `dynamic: false`

- Your package has cyclic aliases or complex re-export patterns
- The build fails with `AttributeError` during introspection
- You're documenting a compiled extension (PyO3/Rust/Cython)

## GitHub Integration

### GitHub Link Style

Choose how the GitHub link appears in the navbar:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
# Shows stars count (default)
github_style: widget

# Or use a simple GitHub icon
github_style: icon
```

### Source Links

Great Docs automatically creates "source" links to GitHub. Configure the branch:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
source:
  branch: main  # Default: auto-detected from git
```

To disable source links entirely:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
source:
  enabled: false
```

Full source link configuration:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
source:
  enabled: true        # Enable/disable source links (default: true)
  branch: main         # Git branch/tag to link to (default: auto-detect)
  path: src/package    # Custom source path for monorepos (default: auto-detect)
  placement: usage     # Where to place the link: "usage" (default) or "title"
```

## Sidebar Filter

The API reference sidebar includes a search filter for large APIs. Configure it:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
sidebar_filter:
  enabled: true   # Enable/disable filter (default: true)
  min_items: 20   # Minimum items before showing filter (default: 20)
```

## Dark Mode Toggle

Great Docs includes a light/dark mode toggle in the navbar that respects system preferences and remembers user choice. It's enabled by default:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
dark_mode_toggle: true   # Enable/disable (default: true)
```

To disable the dark mode toggle:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
dark_mode_toggle: false
```

When enabled, the toggle appears in the navbar and:

- Detects the user's system color scheme preference on first visit
- Persists the user's choice in local storage
- Provides instant switching without page reload

## User Guide Directory

By default, Great Docs looks for a `user_guide/` directory in your project root. To use a different location:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
user_guide: docs/guides
```

The path is relative to the project root. If both the config option and a `user_guide/` directory exist, the config option takes precedence.

See [User Guides](user-guides.qmd) for details on writing and organizing User Guide content.

## CLI Documentation

Enable automatic CLI documentation for Click-based CLIs:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
cli:
  enabled: true
```

With optional explicit configuration:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
cli:
  enabled: true
  module: my_package.cli   # Module containing Click commands
  name: cli                # Name of the Click command object
```

See [CLI Documentation](cli-documentation.qmd) for details.

## Changelog

Great Docs auto-generates a Changelog page from your GitHub Releases. It's enabled by default — if your `pyproject.toml` has a GitHub repository URL, a changelog page will appear automatically.

To customize:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
changelog:
  enabled: true        # Enable/disable changelog (default: true)
  max_releases: 50     # Max releases to include (default: 50)
```

To disable it entirely:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
changelog:
  enabled: false
```

See [Changelog](changelog.qmd) for full details on authentication, CLI usage, and edge cases.

## Author Information

Customize author display in the landing page sidebar:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
authors:
  - name: Your Name
    email: you@example.com
    role: Lead Developer
    affiliation: Organization
    github: yourusername
    homepage: https://yoursite.com
    orcid: 0000-0002-1234-5678
```

Multiple authors are supported:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
authors:
  - name: First Author
    role: Lead Developer
    github: firstauthor

  - name: Second Author
    role: Contributor
    github: secondauthor
```

### Supported Author Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | **Required.** Author's full name |
| `email` | Email address (clickable icon) |
| `role` | Role in the project (e.g., "Lead Developer") |
| `affiliation` | Organization or institution |
| `github` | GitHub username (clickable icon) |
| `homepage` | Personal website URL (clickable icon) |
| `orcid` | ORCID identifier (clickable icon) |

## API Reference Structure

Control how your API documentation is organized with the `reference` config:

```{.yaml filename="great-docs.yml"}
reference:
  - title: Core Classes
    desc: Main classes for working with the package
    contents:
      - name: MyClass
        members: false       # Don't document methods here
      - SimpleClass          # Methods documented inline (default)

  - title: Utility Functions
    desc: Helper functions for common tasks
    contents:
      - helper_func
      - another_func
```

If no `reference` config is provided, Great Docs auto-generates sections from discovered exports.

# Authors
authors:
  - name: Jane Developer
    email: jane@example.com
    role: Lead Developer

```

You don't need all of these settings. Start with just the options you need and add more as your project grows. The defaults work well for most packages, so you may find that a minimal configuration (or none at all) is sufficient.

## Generating a Configuration File

To create a starter `great-docs.yml` with all options documented:

```bash
great-docs config
```

This creates a file with all available options as comments, making it easy to enable the features you need.

## Quarto Configuration

Great Docs generates and maintains a `_quarto.yml` file in your docs directory. This file controls how Quarto renders your site, including navigation, theming, and the quartodoc API reference configuration.

**Should you edit it?** Generally, no. Great Docs updates this file automatically during `great-docs build` to keep API sections in sync with your package exports. Manual edits to the `quartodoc.sections` area will be overwritten. However, you can safely customize other parts like the site title, theme, or additional navbar items.

**Should you commit it?** Yes: commit `_quarto.yml` along with your other docs files. This ensures your documentation builds consistently across environments, including GitHub Actions CI.

**GitHub CI considerations:** When using `great-docs setup-github-pages`, the workflow runs `great-docs build` which regenerates any auto-managed sections. This means CI builds will always use the latest API structure from your code, keeping documentation in sync even if local `_quarto.yml` changes weren't committed.
