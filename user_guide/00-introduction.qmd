# Welcome to Great Docs

Great Docs is a comprehensive documentation site generator for Python packages. It creates beautiful, professional documentation sites with auto-generated API references, smart navigation, and modern styling. Best of all, it requires minimal configuration.

## Why Great Docs?

Creating documentation for Python packages often involves:

- Writing configuration files by hand
- Manually listing every class, function, and method
- Keeping documentation in sync as your API evolves
- Wrestling with styling and navigation

Great Docs eliminates these pain points by:

- **Auto-discovering your API**: Automatically finds and documents your public classes, functions, and methods
- **Intelligent organization**: Groups related items together and handles large classes gracefully
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Modern styling**: Professional appearance with responsive design for all devices

## Key Features

### One-Command Setup

A single `great-docs init` creates your entire documentation site, including:

- Auto-generated `index.qmd` from your `README.md`
- Complete API reference configuration
- Navigation and sidebar setup
- Styling and post-processing scripts

### Auto-Generated API Documentation

Great Docs automatically discovers and documents your package's public API:

- Classes with their methods and attributes
- Functions with parameters and return types
- Smart categorization and organization
- Source code links to GitHub

### CLI Documentation

If your package has a Click-based command-line interface, Great Docs can automatically generate reference pages showing the `--help` output for each command.

### User Guide Support

Create narrative documentation alongside your API reference. Just add `.qmd` files to a `user_guide/` directory and Great Docs handles the rest.
